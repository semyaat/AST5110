Ideally, solutions are solved for each cell avoiding assumptions over multiple mesh cells which can lead to instabilities. The CFL condition is re-arranged to calculate the maximum time-step. A Courant number of 1 will be the maximum theoretical time-step for simulating a stable solution as it is the smallest distance between mesh cells. A Courant number of 0.5 is recommended for an initial guess for a stable solution where it is smaller than the smallest mesh cell-size distance.

The test can also be used to check if the code can satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions since this test has an analytical solution.
